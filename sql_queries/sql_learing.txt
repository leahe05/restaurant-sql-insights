I am putting all the new queries i leaned for sQL in this project

-- ==============================
-- COUNT and GROUP BY Notes
-- ==============================

-- COUNT
-- -----
-- Type: aggregate function
-- What it does: counts rows in a table (or in a group)
-- Variations:
--   COUNT(*)       -> counts all rows
--   COUNT(column)  -> counts only rows where that column is not NULL
-- Example meaning: "How many rows are there?"

-- GROUP BY
-- --------
-- Type: clause (not a function)
-- What it does: groups rows together that share the same value(s)
-- Why: allows aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
--      to be applied to each group instead of the whole table
-- Example meaning: "Split the table by city, then count each city separately"

-- Relationship
-- ------------
-- COUNT works on sets of rows.
-- GROUP BY defines the sets.
-- Without GROUP BY -> COUNT gives one number for the whole table.
-- With GROUP BY    -> COUNT gives one number per group.
